Source code of "Mobile-Kube: Mobility Aware and Energy Efficient Service Orchestration on Kubernetes Edge Servers"

In recent years Kubernetes has become the de facto standard in the realm of service orchestration. Despite its great benefits, there is still a long way to make compatible with decentralised cloud computing platforms. There is an ongoing effort to make it available on distributed edge computing nodes/servers. One of the challenges of mobile edge computing is that the location of the users is changing over time. This mobility will constantly move users to a distant proximity of their connected services. One solution to this problem is to regularly move services to computing nodes closer to the most of the users. However, distributing the services in edge nodes only subject to user movements will result in fragmentation of active nodes. This leads to having a large number of active nodes without the use of their full capacity. In this research we have proposed a method to reduce the latency of Kubernetes applications on mobile edge computing devices while maintaining energy consumption at a reasonable level. Latecncy reduction is achieved by moving the services to Kubernetes nodes closer to the users. On the other hand, Energy consumption is reduced by trying to have the minimum number of active nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. A new state of the art reinforcement learning algorithm named IMPALA have been used in order to maintain a balance between theses two objectives. An experimental framework is designed on top of real-world Kubernetes clusters and real world traces of mobile users movements have been used to simulate the users' mobility. Experimental results have shown the feasibility of design and using reinforcement learning in container placement in Kubernetes driven MEC networks.

1. Objectives
   1. latency reduction: having the services closer to the users
   2. energy comsomption: having the minimum number of active Kuberentes nodes

## Setup the environment in your machine

# 2. Kubernetes Cluster Setup
If you want to do the real world Kubernetes experiemnts of the paper you should also do the following steps.
There are several options for setting up a Kuberentes cluster. The repo codes can connect to the cluster through the [Python client API](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python) as long as you have access to the kube config address e.g. `~/.kube/config` in your config files specified.

We have used [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) for our experiments.
You can find the toturial for creating the cluster on google cloud and locally in the followings:

* [Google cloud installation](docs/kubernetes/installation-gcp.md)
* [Local cluster setup installation](docs/kubernetes/installation-local.md)

formant of the parsed users mobility dataset.
Users data attributes:
1. Creating a CSV file with the size of: 2 * #NUM_OF_USERS + 1, each 3 column contains
the information of one user.
2. For instance, in case when there are 3 users in the network, we have a 7-column table as
follows:

| timesteps | lan1 | lat1 | lan2 | lat2 |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|
|0|35.76727803828804|51.35991084161459|35.76031345070641|1.39458643788907|

### 3.4.1. [Data Generation](experiments/dataset)
The dataset, workloads, networks and traces are generated in the following order:
1. **Datasets**: Nodes, services, their capacities, requested resources and their initial placements. 
2. **Workloads**: The workload for each dataset that determines the resource usage at each time step. This is built on top of the datasets built on step 1. Each dataset can have several workloads.
3. **Networks**: The edge network for each dataset that generates the network with users and stations for the simulation. This contains the network object containing the nodes and stations and intitial location of the users. The network can be built both randomly of based-on the [Cabspotting](https://privamov.github.io/accio/docs/datasets.html) and [California towers stations](antennasearch.com) dataset. This is built on top of the nodes-services datasets built on step 1. Each dataset can have several networks.
4. **Traces**: The movement traces for each network. This is the location of each user at each timestep. This can be a random or based-on [Cabspotting](https://privamov.github.io/accio/docs/) dataset. This is built on top of the networks built in step 3.

The Kubernetes interface is designed based-on the Kubernetes [api version 1](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.21/).

The main operations that are currently implemented are:
* creating
  * cluster
  * utilisation server
  * pods
* actions
  * moving pods
  * deleting pods
  * cleaning nemespace
* monitoring
  * get nodes resource usage
  * get pods resource usage

a sample of using the interface can be found [here](experiments/kube_operations.py)
